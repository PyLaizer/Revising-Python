# Operators : LOL , I Already Know these 😎☺️😚😁

# 1. Arithmetic operators :     +       -     *     /     %     **      //

# 2. Assignment operators:      =       +=      -=      *=      /=      %=      **=     //=     &=      |=      ^=

# 3. Comparison operators:      ==      !=      >       >=      <       <=

# 4. Logical Operators:        and      or      not

# 5. Identity Operators:        is      is not

#6.  Membership Operators:      in      not in

#7.  Bitwise Operators:         &       |       ^       ~
